# TrainTime

Welcome to Train Time! An interactive train scheduler. Use the app here! -> [TrainTime](https://fitharwe.github.io/TrainTime/)

Add the name, destination, original arrival time, and frequency of the train in minutes. 

Once submitted, your train will be added to the board, where you will be able to see it accurately update the time until the next train arrives. 

This can be run in a standard web browser. Contributions can be pushed to this github.
